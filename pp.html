        <div class="demo"><p><ol><li>CHECK the scene for safety, form an initial impression and use personal protective equipment (PPE)</li><hr>

<li>If the person appears unresponsive, CHECK for responsiveness, breathing, life-threatening bleeding or other life-threatening conditions using shout-tap-shout</li><hr>

<li>If the person does not respond and is not breathing or only gasping, CALL 9-1-1 and get equipment, or tell someone to do so</li><hr>
<li>Kneel beside the person. Place the person on their back on a firm, flat surface</li><hr>
<li><The American Red Cross CPR guidelines recommend 100 to 120 chest compressions per minute, 30 at a time. Remember these five points:<ul>Hand position: Two hands centered on the chest
Body position: Shoulders directly over hands; elbows locked
Compression depth: At least 2 inches
Rate of compressions: 100 to 120 per minute
Allow chest to return to normal position after each compression</ul></li><hr>
<li>Give 2 breaths</li><hr>

<li>Open the airway to a past-neutral position using the head-tilt/chin-lift technique
Pinch the nose shut, take a normal breath, and make complete seal over the personâ€™s mouth with your mouth.
Ensure each breath lasts about 1 second and makes the chest rise; allow air to exit before giving the next breath
Note: If the 1st breath does not cause the chest to rise, retilt the head and ensure a proper seal before giving the 2nd breath If the 2nd breath does not make the chest rise, an object may be blocking the airway</li><hr>
<li>
Continue giving sets of 30 chest compressions and 2 breaths. Use an AED as soon as one is available! Minimize interruptions to chest compressions to less than 10 seconds.</li></ol></p></div>
